# Crate System
Simple Crate System for SA-MP servers.

##Introduction

This is a simple 'Lost Crate' system minigame. A crate spawns, and the first player to find the crate gets some rewards such as weapons, and health.

##Features

* Respawn time of 3 minutes
* Easily add your own crate spawn points.
* Crate will destroy at 24:59 gametime if it hasn't been found. Another crate will respawn after that.
* Once the crate is spawned, it will tell it's location.
* Use the command /crate to see your distance from the crate.

##New in Version 2.0

* Map Icons are no longer used since the introduction of /crate and the fact the location is told when the crate is spawned.
* Use /crate to find the distance you are from the crate in meters.
* The location will be told once the crate spawns.
