# Crate System
Simple Crate System for SA-MP servers.

##Introduction

This is a script that I was using when I was running my old freeroam server back in mid 2014. It's a 'Lost Crate' system, and the first player to find the crate gets some rewards such as weapons, and health.

##Features

* Respawn time of 3 minutes
* Easily add your own crate spawn points.
* Crate will destroy at 24:00 gametime if it hasn't been found. Another crate will respawn after that.

##Bugs

None currently.

NOTE: This script was created in 2014, some things in the script may be outdated. I've only modified some small things, nothing major!

##Possible Version 2 Soon!

I'm thinking of making another version of this system. I'd like to add a feature where every 4 minutes it will give you a hint where the crate is. Example:

* 4:00: The crate spawns in a random location.
* 8:00: The location of the crate is revealed.
* 12:00: The closest player to the crate is revealed.
* 16:00: The closest player in meters is revealed.
* 20:00 The crate will be destroyed and a new one will spawn at 24:00


If you have any suggestions please let me know!

Enjoy :)!
